# 1. Anton and Permutations

### Description
Anton loves permutations. You are given a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
You can recursively split the permutation into two non-empty parts and apply the same operation on each part.

The cost of a permutation is defined recursively:
- If its length is 1, cost = 0
- Otherwise, cost = max(cost(left part), cost(right part)) + 1

Find the minimum possible cost to reduce the permutation.

### Input
- First line: integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2×10⁵)
- Second line: permutation of size n

### Output
One integer — the minimum cost.
